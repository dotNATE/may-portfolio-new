    <h1>looking for a web developer?</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nathaniel, a South-West UK based, enthusiastic software developer at the start of a new career!</p>
        <p>For the last four years, I've been working in Bristol as a Recruitment Consultant; a specialist in introducing full stack software developers to SMEs across the South West.</p>
        <p id="aboutMe3">Working in this role gave me an opportunity to speak with developers about their roles on a daily basis, and saw me regularly attending events and meetups in Bristol; this exposure to the software industry inspired me to pursue a career as a developer.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm enrolled onto the ‘Full Stack Track’ with iO Academy in Bath. I’ll be graduating on 18th June 2021 and available to start a new role from Monday 21st June.</p>

                <p>This project was part of the course I took with iO Academy. We were tasked, as two separate, agile teams of 8, to add functionality to a legacy application written in Typescript. I worked on implementing Bootstrap modals throughout the app, adding functionality to the user journey experienced whilst completing the test (using Typescript), and some minor bug fixes.</p>

                <p>This was another group project where I and my team (8 in total) were required to design an application from the ground up that adhered to SOLID principles. We designed a class structure/architecture as a team and worked to implement this using PHP with a minimal front-end, constructed with HTML5 and CSS (using SASS, with a Gulp compiler).</p>
